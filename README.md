<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps:</h2>

<p>1. Step 1: Set Up a Virtual Environment</p>

```
Create a virtual environment using Python's venv module. Activate the virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.
```

<p>2. Step 2: Install Required Packages</p>

```
Create a requirements.txt file listing all necessary packages (FastAPI Uvicorn SQLAlchemy Databases Pydantic Alembic a database driver like psycopg2-binary for PostgreSQL passlib for password hashing and python-jose for JWT token handling).
```

<p>3. Step 3: Set Up the Project Structure</p>

```
Create a project directory for example ecommerce_backend. Inside this directory create an app folder to hold the application's main files. Within the app folder create the following Python files: __init__.py main.py models.py schemas.py  database.py auth.py utils.py At the project root create a requirements.txt file and a run.sh script for running the application.
```

<p>4. Step 4: Configure the Database</p>

```
Edit the database.py file to set up the database connection using SQLAlchemy. Define the connection URL for your chosen database (e.g. SQLite PostgreSQL). Implement functions to initialize the database and create tables.
```

<p>5. Step 5: Define Database Models</p>

```
In the models.py file define SQLAlchemy models for entities such as users products and orders.
```

<p>6. Step 6: Define Pydantic Schemas</p>

```
In the schemas.py file create Pydantic models for request and response validation.
```

<p>7. Step 7: Implement CRUD Operations</p>

```
In the router.py file implement CRUD functions to interact with the database (create read update delete operations).
```

<p>8. Step 8: Set Up Authentication</p>

```
In the auth.py file implement user authentication using OAuth2 and JWT tokens for secure access control.
```

<p>9. Step 9: Test the Application</p>

```
Use the interactive API documentation provided by FastAPI (Swagger UI) to test the endpoints by navigating to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```
